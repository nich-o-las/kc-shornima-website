“Blogs are a conversation no one wanted to have with you.” -- Michelle Wolf

I made this website in January. It is now the end of March, and I am now putting it up. It was done, finished, ready to launch in January, but I was stuck on this one note: Who cares? Who cares if I put up a website? Putting up a website, with a calendar, a picture of me, and a blog with my dumb thoughts that no one cares about is self-important. 
So I’ve been sitting on this website for months now, until this week I struck a new thought: Who cares? Overthinking sending my thoughts out into the ether, the void of the internet, is self-important. Who cares is not a confining question, it’s a liberating feeling. 

Who cares, so why not?

I mean this still makes me feel like an idiot. I looked up “Best Personal Blogs” and of the list I found, around half were defunct sites that led to 404 errors, and the other half were last updated in 2016 at the latest. 
I’m not embarrassed by a lot of things. I can get on stage and talk about deeply personal things in front of 300 strangers. I’ve farted in front of every single guy I’ve dated for more than a week. I can do most things in real life and walk away with my ego and self-image intact, but the online world embarrasses me. I have to force myself to post something on instagram. I swam with sea lions on a lone rock in the pacific. When I got back, I thought about posting a video of a sea lion pup coming up to me, and I thought, “No one cares about that,” as I scrolled past pictures of lattes and selfies and friend-hangs. I don’t think I’m wrong. No one cares about a sea lion pup coming up to me in the ocean. The only thing I’ve seen on Instagram that I found worthwhile is my friend’s dog, Ruth, who responds to, “What’s your name?” with “Hi, I’m Ruth.” I mean it's I’m jealous of anyone who can get out there and post a picture of a latte with confidence, just letting us know what they did that day.
